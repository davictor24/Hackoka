### About
* This project was done by the members of group 10 in the Hackoka hackathon. 
* This is a service which enables people to get information via USSD, without internet connection in any way. It pulls data off the Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo and also the Longman dictionary APIs, depending on the user's preference and search keywords. 
* This would go a long way in bridging the digital divide, as people who may not be able to afford data plans will be able to get information at no cost. 
* The service would be scaled in the future to include more data sources.

### How to use
* Register a USSD channel on Africa's Talking.
* Connect to the API (api.php).
* Type the USSD code and send. This sends a POST request to the API. 
* Enjoy the service.
